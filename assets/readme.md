## Run The Builded Application (Ready to Use)

If you don’t understand how angular works, I provide an application that is ready to use. You can use it easily without having to install NodeJS and Angular first. Go to the `dist/mapLinker` folder and run the `index.html` file using a portable server, for example php-cli. Go to the terminal and run the command:

```php -S localhost: 3000```

Go to your browser and access to the address `http://localhost:3000` to run the application. Make sure you are connected to the internet.

You can also run the application using XAMPP. Make a folder on htdoc, for example with the name ‘mymap’. Move all application files into the mymap folder and then access to the address `http:// localhost/mymap`. Make sure XAMPP is running.

For global installation, you just need to put all the files in the folder into your hosting folder.


 
## File Structure of Builded App

Builded App is in `dist/mapLinker` folder and contain the files below:

```
- index.html
+ assets
  + [countryID]
    - data.json
    - config.json
    - markers.json
    - pages.json
    + markers
      - dot.svg
    + pages
      - mypages.md
- and other js files
```

**DO NOT REMOVE those files!**

## Change HTML Title and Favicon

You can change the HTML Page title by modify the title tag in `index.html`  file.

```
...
<title>[Your App Title]</title>
  <base href="/">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="./assets/dot.ico">
...
```
## Add Custom Color of Area

You can use the custom color of a specific area by adding the attribute in `data.json`.

```
[
    ...
    {     
      ...,
      "color":"green",
      "markers":[],
      "charts":[]
    },
    ..
 ]
```
The color attribute will make the related area colored with green.

## Add Charts Data

Data charts are taken from the data.json file. The data structure in the file is:
```
[
    {
        ...
        "charts":[
            {
                "title":"Column Chart",
                "type":"ColumnChart",
                "columns":["Country", "Value 1", "Value 2"],
                "data":[
                    ["London", 8136000, 678000],
                    ["New York", 8538000, 890200],
                    ["Paris", 2244000,345000],
                    ["Berlin", 3470000, 7891000],
                    ["Kairo", 19500000, 3456999]
                  ]
            },
            ...
      ],
      ...
  },
  ...
]
```
 
You can add data by modifying the chart attributes. The required variables are:
 
**title:**
Title of your charts
 
**type:**
Type of your chart. Charts library is using Google Charts. You can refer to the chart type of the library. You can get the charts gallery here.
 
**columns:**
Column name of data. Column length data and data item must be the same. For example, if column data is `[“Country”, “Value 1”, “Value 2”]` then the each item of data must have 3 items.
 
**data:**
Data content that will present in charts. The structure of each item is `[“label”, value1, value2]`. The label must be string and the value must be integer or double.
 
**DO NOT modify the stateCode and stateName attributes.**

## Add Local Marker

Local marker is the markers that shown only if the area is selected. Modifu the `data.json` file to add your local marker.

```
...
"markers":[
        {
          "lat":-0.7622,
          "lon": 113.0637,
          "src":"./assets/local_marker.svg",
          "text":"local marker",
          "data":{
            "title":"Local Marker Description",
            "content":"./assets/ID/pages/jakarta.md"
          }
        }
]
...
```
Add the above attribute to the item of data.json. If `markers` attribute exist in the object then markers will be shown when the user selects the area. You can get the lat and lon attribute from openstreetmap.org. For example, you get the url below:

```
https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=indonesia#map=9/-6.2197/106.9533&layers=H
```

Based on the url, lat value is -6.2197 and lon value is 106.9533. You also can use your own marker image in png or svg and add the text using `text` attribute. If you want to make the marker is clickable, you can add the `data` attributes with the `title` will displayed in the title of dialog and `content` will display in content dialog. The `content` attribute is the url that call your markdown file. Place your markdown file anywhere in assets folder.


## Add Markers Data
 
You can add the markers into the map with your own image marker and title. To add the marker, please modify the markers.json file. Structure of the file is:

```
[
    {
        "lon": 115.8604796,
        "lat":-31.9527121,
        "src":"./assets/markers/dot.svg",
        "text":"",
        "data":{
          "title":"Your dialog title",
          "content":"path/to/yourfile.md"
        }
    },
    {
        "lon":130.30,
        "lat":-24.847,
        "src":"./assets/markers/dot.svg",
        "text":"Your marker text"
